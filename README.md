Gov 51 Section Slides
================

This repository contains the code used to build slides for section 
meetings of Gov 51, which is the second course in the quantitative 
sequence for undergraduates in the Harvard Government Department. 
These slides were made for the Spring 2024 iteration of the 
class taught by Professor [Naijia Liu](https://naijialiu.github.io/). 

Compilation of RMD files can be done in any R compiler. A LaTeX 
typesetter may be necessary. A mix of native datasets, locally 
provided ones, and those directly from the course website.
